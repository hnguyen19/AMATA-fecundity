I sincerely thank the R user community, `bookdown` authors, Overleaf, Zotero, Stackoverflow, and ISU Lunchinators for inspiration, coaching, and troubleshooting. 
This current structure works best for me, though mysterious package conflicts sometimes generate raw LaTeX codes in the middle of a neat .pdf. Sometimes I can solve this, sometimes I cannot. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have if you come across my work.

The folder directory is detailed below: 

+ 1 Background: relevant .pdf files of the literature   
+ 2 Data: raw and clean data sheets  
+ 3 Picture: relevant diagrams
+ 4 Data wrangling: `.R` files with codes to clean the raw data  
+ 5 Analysis: `.Rmd` executable files to analyze the data and render reports. Each `.Rmd` file is devoted to address one set of hypothesis. `functions.R`, that contains customized functions from existing functions, is also stored here.
+ 6 Draft: to put everything together. `fecund.bib` (the Zotero generated bibliography) `Introduction.Rmd`, `Proposal.Rmd` for materials and methods, and `Discussion.Rmd` live there.   
+ 7 Extra: diagnosis scripts in `.Rmd` format and rendered outputs that are not included in the manuscrtipt. 

General workflow:  
1 - Each `.Rmd` file in the `5 Analysis` folder is devoted to address one set of hypothesis. 
2 - All the pieces are put together under `Draft.Rmd`. The execution of `Draft.Rmd` will generate: 
  i) a latex-figure folder contains all the figures from the `.Rmd` files. This folder is automatically generated from knitting a `.pdf` file from `.Rmd`
  ii) a `.tex` file and a `.pdf` file.  
3 - The `Whole manuscript.tex` file is uploaded to Overleaf for final polishing that are very inconvenient or impossible to do in R. 

4 - `Waterhemp_fecundity_Jan14.pdf` is the currently submitted format.
