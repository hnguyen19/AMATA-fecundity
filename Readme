I sincerely thank the R user community, `bookdown` authors, Overleaf, Zotero, Stackoverflow, and ISU Lunchinators for inspiration, coaching, and troubleshooting. 
This current structure works best for me, though mysterious package conflicts sometimes generate raw LaTeX codes in the middle of a neat .pdf. Sometimes I can solve this, sometimes I cannot. I would appreciate any suggestions you may have if you come across my work.

The following folders are populated as the manuscript submission progresses: 

+ 1-Background: relevant .pdf files of the literature   
+ 2-Data: raw and clean data sheets  
+ 3-Picture: relevant diagrams
+ 4-Data-wrangling: `.R` files with codes to clean the raw data  
+ 5-Analysis: `.Rmd` executable files to analyze the data and render reports. Each `.Rmd` file is devoted to address one set of hypothesis. `functions.R`, that contains customized functions from existing functions, is also stored here.
+ 6-Draft: to put everything together. `fecund.bib` (the Zotero generated bibliography) `Introduction.Rmd`, `Proposal.Rmd` for materials and methods, and `Discussion.Rmd` live there.   
+ 7-Extra: diagnosis scripts in `.Rmd` format and rendered outputs that are not included in the manuscrtipt. 

General workflow in the 6_Draft folder:  
1 - Each `.Rmd` file in the `5-Analysis` folder is devoted to address one set of hypothesis. 
2 - All the pieces are put together under `Manuscript_whole.Rmd`. The execution of `Manuscript_whole.Rmd will generate: 
  i) `Manuscript_whole_files/latex-figure` folder that contains all the .png figures from the `.Rmd` files. 
  ii) a `.tex` file and a `.pdf` file of the same name, i.e. "Manuscript_whole".
  
3 - The `Whole manuscript.tex` file is uploaded to Overleaf for final polishing that are very inconvenient or impossible to do in R. 
Any textual edit after the first round of manuscript submission will be done on Overleaf if maneuvering `.Rmd` files generate two many latex raw codes. 

4 - `Waterhemp_fecundity_Jan14.pdf` is the currently submitted format.  

5 - `Waterhemp_fecundity_Feb1.pdf` is the round 2 revision.
